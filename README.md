# wedit

A text editor written in C. This is mainly for educational purposes, and is not meant to be a good text editor. Although, who knows its future fate?

It is not in a usable state yet, and barely renders text.

To build, just run `make`! There are currently no dependencies, other than a POSIX-compatible system.
